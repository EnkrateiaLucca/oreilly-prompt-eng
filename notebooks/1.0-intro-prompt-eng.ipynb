    "# Prompt Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt is a piece of text that conveys to a LLM what the user wants. What the user wants can be many things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Asking a question\n",
    "- Giving an instruction\n",
    "- Etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "The key components of a prompt are:\n",
    "1. Instruction: where you describe what you want\n",
    "2. Context: additional information to help with performance\n",
    "3. Input data: data the model has not seem to illustrate what you need\n",
    "4. Output indicator: How you prime the model to output what you want, for example asking the model [\"Let's think step by step\" and the end of a prompt can boost reasoning performance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf). You can also write \"Output:\" to prime the model to just write the output and nothing else.\n",

    "[Prompts can also be seen as a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM.](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2302.11382#:~:text=prompts%20are%20also%20a%20form%20of%20programming%20that%20can%20customize%20the%20outputs%20and%20interactions%20with%20an%20llm.)"

    "1 Introduction\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\n",
    "in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\n",
    "transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous\n",
    "efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\n",
    "architectures [38, 24, 15].\n",
    "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\n",
    "sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\n",
    "states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\n",
    "sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\n",
    "sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\n",
    "significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\n",
    "computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",
    "constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
    "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduction models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\n",
    "the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\n",
    "are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
    "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\n",
    "relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
    "The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\n",
    "translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
    "2 Background\n",
    "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",
    "[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\n",
    "block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\n",
    "the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\n",
    "in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\n",
    "it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\n",
    "reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\n",
    "to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\n",
    "described in section 3.2.\n",
    "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\n",

    "3 Model Architecture\n",
    "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\n",
    "Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\n",
    "of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\n",
    "sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n",
    "[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",

    "Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n",
    "The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",
    "connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
    "respectively.\n",
    "3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
    "Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
    "sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, positionwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\n",
    "the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
    "LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
    "itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
    "layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n",
    "Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
    "sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
    "attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
    "around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
    "sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\n",
    "masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
    "predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
    "3.2 Attention\n",
    "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",
    "where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n",

    "query with all keys, divide each by √\n",
    "dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\n",
    "values.\n",

    ". Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\n",

    "While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\n",
    "dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\n",

    "dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\n",
    "is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n",
    "3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n",
    "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
    "• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
    "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
    "position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",
    "typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",
    "[38, 2, 9].\n",
    "• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n",
    "and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n",
    "encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
    "encoder.\n",
    "• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
    "all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
    "information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
    "inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\n",
    "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
    "3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
    "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
    "connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
    "consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
    "FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\n",
    "While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\n",
    "from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",
    "The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
    "df f = 2048.\n",
    "3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",
    "Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
    "tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transformation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\n",
    "our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\n",
    "linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √\n",

    "Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\n",
    "order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\n",
    "tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\n",
    "bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\n",
    "as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\n",
    "learned and fixed [9].\n",
    "In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n",
    "P E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n",
    "P E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n",
    "where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\n",
    "corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\n",
    "chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\n",
    "relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\n",
    "P Epos.\n",
    "We also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\n",
    "versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\n",
    "because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\n",
    "during training.\n",
    "4 Why Self-Attention\n",
    "In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolutional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n",
    "(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi\n",
    ", zi ∈ R\n",
    "d\n",
    ", such as a hidden\n",
    "layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
    "consider three desiderata.\n",
    "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
    "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
    "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
    "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
    "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
    "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
    "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\n",
    "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
    "different layer types.\n",
    "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
    "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
    "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
    "6\n",
    "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
    "sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
    "[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
    "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
    "the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
    "path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
    "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
    "positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",
    "or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\n",
    "between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
    "recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\n",
    "considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d\n",
    "2\n",
    "). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\n",
    "convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\n",
    "the approach we take in our model.\n",
    "As side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\n",
    "from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\n",
    "heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\n",
